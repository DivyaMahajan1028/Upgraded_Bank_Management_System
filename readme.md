üöÄ Upgraded Bank Management System with Python & MySQL üí≥üìä

An all-in-one Bank Management System that combines powerful Python logic with advanced SQL queries. This upgraded version goes beyond basic banking operations ‚Äî adding transaction logging, SQL analytics, and professional data tracking using CTEs, window functions, and subqueries.

üóÉÔ∏è Database Schema

üî∏ customer_info

CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS customer_info (
  Name VARCHAR(20),
  pin INT,
  Balance INT DEFAULT 0
);

üî∏ transaction_log

CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS transaction_log (
  id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
  name VARCHAR(20),
  pin INT,
  action VARCHAR(10),
  amount INT,
  timestamp DATETIME DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
);

üìä Advanced SQL Queries

These queries demonstrate how your project uses real-world Data Analytics features inside a simple bank system.

1Ô∏è‚É£ Rank Customers by Total Credits (CTE + Window Function)

WITH credit_totals AS (
  SELECT name, SUM(amount) AS total_credit
  FROM transaction_log
  WHERE action = 'credit'
  GROUP BY name
)
SELECT name, total_credit,
  RANK() OVER (ORDER BY total_credit DESC) AS credit_rank
FROM credit_totals;
-- Output:
-- DIVYA    602800     1
-- ROHAN     10800     2
-- OM         8000     3
-- PRIYA      3000     4
-- MAYA       1301     5

2Ô∏è‚É£ Customers With Withdrawals Above Their Own Average (Correlated Subquery)

SELECT DISTINCT name
FROM transaction_log t1
WHERE t1.action = 'debit'
  AND t1.amount > (
    SELECT AVG(amount)
    FROM transaction_log t2
    WHERE t2.name = t1.name AND t2.action = 'debit'
);
-- Output:
-- ROHAN

3Ô∏è‚É£ Ranking by Withdrawals Per Customer (CTE + DENSE_RANK)

WITH user_withdrawals AS (
  SELECT name, SUM(amount) AS total_withdrawn
  FROM transaction_log
  WHERE action = 'debit'
  GROUP BY name
)
SELECT name, total_withdrawn,
       DENSE_RANK() OVER (ORDER BY total_withdrawn DESC) AS withdrawal_rank
FROM user_withdrawals;
-- Output:
-- DIVYA   50000     1
-- ROHAN    7000     2
-- OM       2000     3
-- PRIYA    1000     4
-- MAYA      300     5

4Ô∏è‚É£ Top 3 Frequent Customers (CTE)

WITH customer_counts AS (
  SELECT name, COUNT(*) AS count_number
  FROM transaction_log
  GROUP BY name
)
SELECT * FROM customer_counts ORDER BY count_number DESC LIMIT 3;
-- Output:
-- MAYA      7
-- ROHAN     5
-- DIVYA     4

5Ô∏è‚É£ Running Balance Over Time for a Specific User (Window Function)

SELECT name, action, amount, timestamp,
  SUM(CASE WHEN action = 'CREDIT' THEN amount ELSE -amount END)
    OVER (PARTITION BY name ORDER BY timestamp) AS running_balance
FROM transaction_log
WHERE name = 'DIVYA'
ORDER BY timestamp;
-- Output:
-- credit   100000    ‚Üí 100000
-- credit     2000    ‚Üí 102000
-- debit     50000    ‚Üí 52000
-- credit   500800    ‚Üí 552800

6Ô∏è‚É£ Last 3 Transactions Per User (CTE + ROW_NUMBER)

WITH txn_rank AS (
  SELECT *, ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY name ORDER BY timestamp DESC) AS rn
  FROM transaction_log
)
SELECT * FROM txn_rank WHERE rn <= 3;
-- Output:
-- Shows each user's latest 3 transactions, like:
-- DIVYA: credit 500800, debit 50000, credit 2000
-- MAYA: debit 300, credit 100, credit 400
-- ROHAN: debit 2000, debit 5000, credit 5000

7Ô∏è‚É£ Average Daily Transaction Volume (Nested Subqueries)

SELECT txn_date, COUNT(*) AS txn_count
FROM (
  SELECT DATE(timestamp) AS txn_date
  FROM transaction_log
) AS daily
GROUP BY txn_date;
-- Output:
-- 2025-07-04     21

üìÇ analytics_queries.sql ‚Äì Optional Test Data & Queries

You can optionally include an analytics_queries.sql file that contains:

‚úÖ Sample test data (credits, debits, with backdated timestamps)

‚úÖ The exact SQL queries shown above for easy execution

‚úÖ Output comments to verify query results

üí° This helps showcase real analytics even if your live app has no old user data.
