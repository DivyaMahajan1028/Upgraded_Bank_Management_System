üñ•Ô∏è VS Code / OBS Studio (for video demo)

üí° Key Features

‚úÖ Register New Customers with Auto-PIN Generation‚úÖ Authenticate Users with PIN Login‚úÖ Credit & Debit Transactions with Validation‚úÖ Track All Transactions in a SQL Table‚úÖ Transaction History with Timestamp Logs‚úÖ Real-time Balance Updates‚úÖ Secure Account Deletion Option‚úÖ Full SQL Analytical Queries (CTE, Window Function, Subquery)

üóÉÔ∏è Database Schema

üî∏ customer_info

CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS customer_info (
  Name VARCHAR(20),
  pin INT,
  Balance INT DEFAULT 0
);

üî∏ transaction_log

CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS transaction_log (
  id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
  name VARCHAR(20),
  pin INT,
  action VARCHAR(10),
  amount INT,
  timestamp DATETIME DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
);

üìä Advanced SQL Queries

These queries demonstrate how your project uses real-world Data Analytics features inside a simple bank system.

1Ô∏è‚É£ Rank Customers by Total Credits (CTE + Window Function)

WITH credit_totals AS (
  SELECT name, SUM(amount) AS total_credit
  FROM transaction_log
  WHERE action = 'credit'
  GROUP BY name
)
SELECT name, total_credit,
  RANK() OVER (ORDER BY total_credit DESC) AS credit_rank
FROM credit_totals;

2Ô∏è‚É£ Customers With Withdrawals Above Their Own Average (Correlated Subquery)

SELECT DISTINCT name
FROM transaction_log t1
WHERE t1.action = 'debit'
  AND t1.amount > (
    SELECT AVG(amount)
    FROM transaction_log t2
    WHERE t2.name = t1.name AND t2.action = 'debit'
);

3Ô∏è‚É£ Ranking by Withdrawals Per Customer (CTE + DENSE_RANK)

WITH user_withdrawals AS (
  SELECT name, SUM(amount) AS total_withdrawn
  FROM transaction_log
  WHERE action = 'debit'
  GROUP BY name
)
SELECT name, total_withdrawn,
       DENSE_RANK() OVER (ORDER BY total_withdrawn DESC) AS withdrawal_rank
FROM user_withdrawals;

4Ô∏è‚É£ Top 3 Frequent Customers (CTE)

WITH customer_counts AS (
  SELECT name, COUNT(*) AS count_number
  FROM transaction_log
  GROUP BY name
)
SELECT * FROM customer_counts ORDER BY count_number DESC LIMIT 3;

5Ô∏è‚É£ Running Balance Over Time for a Specific User (Window Function)

SELECT name, action, amount, timestamp,
  SUM(CASE WHEN action = 'CREDIT' THEN amount ELSE -amount END)
    OVER (PARTITION BY name ORDER BY timestamp) AS running_balance
FROM transaction_log
WHERE name = 'DIVYA'
ORDER BY timestamp;

6Ô∏è‚É£ Last 3 Transactions Per User (CTE + ROW_NUMBER)

WITH txn_rank AS (
  SELECT *, ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY name ORDER BY timestamp DESC) AS rn
  FROM transaction_log
)
SELECT * FROM txn_rank WHERE rn <= 3;

7Ô∏è‚É£ Average Daily Transaction Volume (Nested Subqueries)

SELECT txn_date, COUNT(*) AS txn_count
FROM (
  SELECT DATE(timestamp) AS txn_date
  FROM transaction_log
) AS daily
GROUP BY txn_date;
